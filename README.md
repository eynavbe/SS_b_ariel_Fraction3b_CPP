## Fraction
class named Fraction that represents a fraction of two integers. Overload the following operators for this class:

* The + operator to add two fractions and return their sum as another fraction in reduced form.
* The - operator to subtract two fractions and return their difference as another fraction in reduced form.
* The * operator to multiply two fractions and return their product as another fraction in reduced form.
* The / operator to divide two fractions and return their quotient as another fraction in reduced form.
* The == operator to compare two fractions for equality and return true or false.
* All comparison operations (>,<,>=,<=)
* The ++ and -- operator that adds (or substracts) 1 to the fraction. implement both pre and post fix.
* The << operator to print a fraction to an output stream in the format “numerator/denominator”.
* The >> operator to read a fraction from an input stream by taking two integers as input.
All operators should work on both sides on fractions and floats type variables.
